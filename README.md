This is a talk I'm presenting at AmsterdamX.pm in November of 2013, and Milwaukee.pm in December 2013.

The presentation is available from http://hoelz.ro/talks/perl-power-tools/index.html

The master branch contains the slides without any extra text; these are the slides I present with.
The handouts branch contains the slides with extra information for independent viewing.  You can
build the slides using the `build-slides.pl` script.
